## Task

Product returns pose a serious problem for online marketplaces. Statistics show that approximately 15% to 40% of all online purchases are returned, which not only creates financial difficulties for businesses, but also poses serious environmental problems due to the huge amount of goods ending up in landfills. To reduce the number of returns, it is critical for sellers to be able to identify the reasons for returns as early as possible. However, this information often becomes available only after a significant number of product returns. Understanding the reasons for product returns and predicting them can go a long way in reducing this problem.

## Target

Develop a machine learning model that will solve a multi-class classification problem and predict the probability distribution of reasons for returning a product based on many factors, including textual customer reviews.
